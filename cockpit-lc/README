Order of work for KSP-N3923-2_2018ku

1. Update ObjData.py with new data, ex: filenames, time, user.
2. Synchronize new raw *.fz files from remote server. Unpack into *.fits files.
   >python DataSetup.py
3. Crop raw *.fits files into *.crop.fits files.
   >python CropFits.py
4. Remake light curve
   >python LCgen.py

Note:
To avoid confusion, don't forget to date each LC in ObjData using outXname.
Binned early light curve doesn't need to be remade, *180426.txt should be good.

Data Info:
verified that crop images at size 2000 have enough reference stars
verified that images don't need subtraction

Next Steps:
need to update light curve with new data

For testing images:
